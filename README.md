EPANET
======

The EPANET Library is a pressurized pipe network hydraulic and water quality analysis toolkit written in C. 

__Note:__ This is not the "official" release of EPANET -- for that, please go to [the USEPA website](http://www2.epa.gov/water-research/epanet). 

However, if you are interested in extending EPANET for academic, personal, or commercial use, then this is probably a good place to be.
