EPANET
======

The EPANET Library is a pressurized pipe network hydraulic and water quality analysis toolkit written in C. 

__Note:__ This is not the "official" release of EPANET -- for that, please go to [the USEPA website](http://www2.epa.gov/water-research/epanet). It is also not the graphical user interface version. This is the hydraulic and water quality solver engine, also known as the "toolkit".

However, if you are interested in extending EPANET for academic, personal, or commercial use, then you've come to the right place. For community discussion, FAQ, and roadmapping of the project, go to the [Community Forum](http://community.wateranalytics.org/category/epanet).
